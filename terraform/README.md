# IAM Key Rotator

![Test](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/paliwalvimal/aws-iam-key-rotator/test/main?label=Test&style=for-the-badge) ![Checkov](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/paliwalvimal/aws-iam-key-rotator/checkov/main?label=Checkov&style=for-the-badge)

This terraform module will deploy the following services:
- DynamoDB Table
- IAM Role
- IAM Role Policy
- CloudWatch Event
- Lambda

**Note:** You need to implement [remote backend](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/settings/backends/index.html) by yourself and is recommended.
